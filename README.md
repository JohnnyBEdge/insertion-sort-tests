# Insertion Sort - Algorithm Evaluation

## Objective

Employers expect an interviewee to speak intelligently about algorithms and data structures during a technical interview. The student will explain their implementation of a common algorithm used in computer science; they will select from a list of algorithms presented during the boot camp. They will also explain BigO notation and how it applies to evaluate the performance of their selected algorithm. Alongside their common algorithm implementation, students will implement a testing suite with unit tests to verify their algorithm code works against a variety of edge cases.

### Requirements

- Common algorithm implemented by hand by the student
- Good understanding of BigO notation as it applies to performance
- Ability to evaluate a function and determine its BigO notation (shortcut method, no need for complex math)
